engi1006 Flask Project

I used git and flask to create a website that follows the directions described in the final assignment.

On the home page, there is a photo of myself. I formatted using different colors and text sizes for the
header, body, and links. I played around with styling in on the home page (see index.html). I used both
normal styling syntax and also a class "purple" to change text color. I used the <a> href attribute to 
link to different pages. The first two pages have separate htmls (called through render_template) while
the last is a plain link (<a> href). The first two pages also both have pictures at the top of the page.
Everything is written lowercase on my website to maintain a lowkey, minimalistic feel. I made the
sufficient number of commits through the terminal on my laptop (git add ., git commit -m "msg", git push,
etc).

The first link goes to a page 'about me' that describes a little about myself.
The second link goes to a page 'classes' that describes my classes this past semester.
The third link is a surprise link. :)

Hope you're doing well during this time. I hope that surprise was enough to bring a smile and some joy
to your day. :) Have a great summer.
